During the industrial training period, the intern was actively involved in UI/UX design activities using Figma. Prior knowledge of UI/UX principles provided a foundation that was strengthened through continuous practice and exposure to real-world design scenarios.

Using Figma enabled the creation of structured layouts, organized interface elements, and maintained visual consistency across designs. Activities included simple mobile application screens, website layout designs, and visual mock-ups that demonstrated interface structure and user flow. Flyer and poster layouts were also produced for various events and announcements.

Throughout these activities, key UI/UX principles such as alignment, spacing, consistency, typography, and thoughtful color usage were applied. Emphasis was placed on clarity and visual appeal to help customers easily understand and approve design outputs.

\subsection{Projects}

\subsubsection{Exploring the Figma Interface Further}

This was an interactive training session with the supervisor, not a client request. It served as hands-on skill development to strengthen foundational UI/UX capabilities.

The training session focused on exploring advanced features of the Figma interface. Activities included practicing with the pen tool to create complex shapes and curves, designing logos using vector manipulation tools, and creating simple business cards to understand layout principles and spatial composition. The exercises emphasized precision, visual balance, and effective use of design elements.

Key tools and features utilized during this training included the \textbf{Figma pen tool} for vector drawing and creating custom shapes, \textbf{frames} for organizing design elements into structured layouts, \textbf{text objects} for typography practice and understanding font hierarchies, and various \textbf{vector manipulation tools} for editing and refining shapes.

Creating Bézier curves proved difficult initially, requiring practice to master smooth curves and anchor point manipulation. Understanding how control handles affected curve shapes demanded repeated attempts and careful observation. Through continued practice, proficiency improved gradually.

The training was evaluated by the supervisor. Performance was satisfactory though there was room for improvement in mastering complex vector shapes. The session successfully built confidence in using Figma's core design tools and prepared the intern for client-facing design work.

\subsubsection{Skill Level Display}

This project was an opportunity to demonstrate existing Figma capabilities to the supervisor before handling client work. It served as a practical assessment of design skills and aesthetic judgment.

The project involved creating three burial invitation card templates from scratch. Activities included applying layout design principles to create somber and respectful designs appropriate for memorial contexts, selecting appropriate typography that conveyed dignity and solemnity, and choosing color schemes that reflected the nature of memorial cards. Each template featured distinct layouts while maintaining thematic consistency.

Tools and features used included \textbf{frames} for establishing card structure and organizing content areas, the \textbf{SVG library} for accessing decorative elements and symbols appropriate for memorial cards, \textbf{rich font sets} for selecting elegant typography that suited the formal tone, and the \textbf{lines and pen tool} for creating borders and decorative elements that enhanced visual appeal.

Finding appropriate SVG assets that conveyed the right tone for burial invitations presented a challenge. Many available graphics were either too cheerful or insufficiently respectful for the context. Color selection was also challenging, as memorial cards required subdued, dignified palettes. These challenges were resolved by researching online examples of memorial card designs for inspiration and gathering appropriate visual references.

Successfully created three well-crafted burial invitation templates with carefully chosen layouts and visual elements. The supervisor commended the work, particularly noting the appropriate tone and professional presentation. The templates demonstrated competence in handling sensitive design projects and understanding context-appropriate aesthetics.

\subsubsection{My First Client Request}

This was the first client-facing project assigned by the supervisor—a graduation invitation card requested by a customer. It marked a significant milestone in transitioning from training exercises to real customer work.

Activities performed included meeting with the client to understand specific requirements and preferences, designing a graduation invitation card based on the client's hardcopy sample, incorporating requested visual elements and text content, and making revisions based on client feedback received during review sessions. The project required careful attention to detail and effective communication to ensure client satisfaction.

Tools and features utilized included \textbf{rectangles} for creating card structure and defining layout zones for text and imagery, \textbf{frames} for organizing design elements and maintaining alignment, \textbf{vector objects} for adding decorative elements that enhanced visual appeal, and the \textbf{pen tool} for creating custom shapes and design accents that matched the celebratory theme.

The client provided a hardcopy sample as reference, making color extraction difficult. Matching colors accurately without digital references required multiple attempts and careful visual comparison. The process involved creating color swatches, testing them against the physical sample under different lighting conditions, and making iterative adjustments until acceptable matches were achieved.

The client was highly satisfied with the final design and delivery speed. She provided a tip and made only minor modifications to the approved design. The efficient turnaround time and quality were particularly appreciated. This successful first client interaction built confidence and demonstrated the ability to meet customer expectations under real working conditions.
