This report details the Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) training undertaken at Litashub Cyber Cafe in Benin City, Edo State. The program provided comprehensive practical exposure to professional digital services, with a primary focus on UI/UX design, technical document typesetting, and general office operations. During the four-month internship, significant proficiency was developed in using industry-standard tools such as Figma for interface design and LaTeX for professional document preparation.

Key projects included the end-to-end design of a landing page for Litas Travels and the prototyping of a mobile-based Attendance System, which involved creating responsive layouts and reusable component libraries. In parallel, the intern handled the typesetting of complex academic and legal documents, ensuring strict adherence to formatting standards. The report further discusses the challenges encountered, such as mastering vector graphic tools and managing high-volume print workflows, and the problem-solving strategies employed to overcome them. Ultimately, this industrial training successfully bridged the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and their practical application, equipping the intern with valuable technical skills and professional experience necessary for the modern workforce.
