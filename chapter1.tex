As a key part of the Nigerian tertiary education system, it serves to connect classroom theory with practical industry work, giving students the chance to gain hands-on experience, build technical skills, and understand professional work ethics before graduation. By participating in these industrial activities, students are better prepared for their future careers, gaining skills that employers value while also learning to interact with professionals, adapt to workplace cultures, and develop essential problem-solving abilities. Overall, SIWES plays a crucial role in improving students' employability and guiding their professional growth.
